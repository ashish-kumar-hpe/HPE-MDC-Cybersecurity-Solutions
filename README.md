# HPE-MDC-Cybersecurity-Solutions
The HPE Cybersecurity Graph Analytics solution offering for FSI is designed for infinitely scalable cyber network to keep track of massive volume of endpoint vulnerabilities across deployed infrastructure. This solution can help detect largest and richest attack surfaces surfacing with frequency of cyber incidents up to 300 times more attacks in FSI than other industries. This solution takes advantage of HPE Superdome Flex Memory-Driven Computing architecture and achieves order of magnitude reduced time taken to detect known threats from hours to seconds.
